## üìä Project Highlights

### 1. Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze customer reviews from Kindle products to determine sentiment polarity.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
  - Feature extraction using Word2Vec
  - Classification using machine learning models

### 2. Parts of Speech and Named Entity Recognition
- **Objective:** Identify grammatical components and named entities in text.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - POS tagging using NLTK
  - Named Entity Recognition to extract entities like names, locations, etc.

### 3. Stemming and Stopword Removal
- **Objective:** Demonstrate text normalization techniques.
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Applying stemming algorithms (e.g., Porter Stemmer)
  - Removing common stopwords to reduce noise in text data
